Description
-----------

  PsiMedia is a thick abstraction layer for providing audio and video RTP
  services to Psi-like IM clients.  The implementation is based on GStreamer.

  Contents:
    psimedia/      API and plugin shim
    gstprovider/   provider plugin based on GStreamer
    demo/          demonstration GUI program

  To build the plugin and demo program, run:
    ./configure
    make


Building from SVN
------------------
First, install the 'qconf' program, at least version 1.4.  You can download
the source here:
  http://delta.affinix.com/qconf/

Then, go into the PsiMedia source tree and type 'qconf'.  You should now have
a configure program to execute, just like from a normal source package.

Build dependencies:
* qconf (https://github.com/psi-plus/qconf)
* Qt >= 5.6
* glib >= 2.0
* gobject >= 2.0
* gthread >= 2.0
* gstreamer >= 1.10.4
* gstreamer-base >= 1.10.4

Building the plugin and demo program:
$ qt-qconf
$ ./configure
$ make

There is no `make install` target. The compiled plugin can be found under the
gstprovider directory.  An application that uses PsiMedia should have
instructions on what to do with the plugin.

For Psi+ program gstprovider plugin should be placed into:
* /usr/lib/psi-plus/plugins/ on Linux systems
* the root Psi+ directory on MS Windows systems
  (for example, c:\\Program Files\Psi+\)

If you want to test demo program, use environment variable PSI_MEDIA_PLUGIN
for setting the path to gstprovider plugin. For example:
$ PSI_MEDIA_PLUGIN=/usr/lib/psi-plus/plugins/libgstprovider.so ./demo

# GstProvider plugin

This is a standalone Qt plug-in using gstprovider library.

Essentially the only method of the plugin is `createProvider`. Which return an object using all the other interfaces defined in `psimedia` directory.

Note, the plugin is rather designed for the demo application in this repository but if necessary can be used in 3rdparty applications.

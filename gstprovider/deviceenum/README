DeviceEnum looks up devices using platform-specific APIs and approaches.  It
does not depend on GStreamer, but the results can be used with GStreamer.

GStreamer does actually support device detection on its own, but results are
spotty.  If the day comes where detection through GStreamer works 100% then we
can deprecate DeviceEnum.
